<h4>Some Notes</h4>
<span>Our main style sheet is loaded through the index.js file meaning we do not import styles and scripts in the html<span><br>
<span>All styles are stored in the sass dir from where they are recompiled and stored in css/style.css</span><br>
<span>We prefer an OOP approach to implementing new features. The proposed design is every js file should de a class that can be imported in our root Js file<span>
